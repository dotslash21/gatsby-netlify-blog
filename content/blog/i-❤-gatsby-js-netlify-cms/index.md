Traditionally, hosting and managing a website required a lot of technical expertise and patience. Then came the age of **WordPress** and all other **CMS** which made managing content and designing pages easier for non tech savy user. In spite of all their plus points, the technical users wanted something more customizable but still easily manageable. Here's where the concept of headless CMS comes into the picture.
